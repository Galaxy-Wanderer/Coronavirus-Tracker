# Coronavirus-Tracker
My deadly app that tracks Coronavirus all around the world.
The information might not be true (cuz panicked people think if someone dies, he dies because of the Covid19), but it was fun to make.

## Setup

Write in your terminal to install all the dependencies:
`npm install`

Then to start the server write:
`npm start`

The server will start at localhost:3000
